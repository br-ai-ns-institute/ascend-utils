# ascend quickstart tutorials
These tutorials are intended to get one quickly up to speed on Ascend platform.
The platform uses TF 1.15, and the models need to be adjusted manually to work with Ascend
devices properly, which is often not clear, and there are a lot of parameters that need to
be set (and that can be set).
